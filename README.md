This project is build with vanilla Javascript, with the help of '[random user api](https://randomuser.me/api/portraits)'. At the top you'll notice there's a progress bar, when it reaches the end after 10 seconds and new testimonial will appoear.

## Built With

You should be familiar with Javascript basics and DOM manipulation. However, I've included some links to the methods that might not be familiar to a beginner.

- [HTMLElement: animationiteration event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/animationiteration_event)

## Installation

This is a working code example.
You can copy the CSS and Javascript code as is and use it in your projects.
Or you can download the code as a ZIP file and unzip it. No web server required, you can see it live through your localhost by opening index.html with your browser. Alternatively, you can open your project with VS Code and click on **Go Live** at the bottom right corner, it should open in your default browser.
